            <h4><b><span>In the Foot Hill of Himalayan</span></b></h4>

            <p2>
                Landlocked and located between China and India, Nepal has the greatest change in altitude of any place on earth. While the lowlands sit at sea level, the Himalaya mountain range represents the tallest peaks in the world. Named for the mythological Hindu sage, Ne, Nepal features a diverse geography with 5 climatic zones, wooded hills, fertile plains, and mountains.

                Nepal provides plenty of interest for climbers, as it is home to Mt. Everest, as well as 8 of the tallest mountains in the world. The country also features several UNESCO World Heritage Sites and religious temples, monasteries, and shrines. For adventure travelers and outdoor enthusiasts, Nepal is a “must see” addition to their bucket lists.

                Known for their friendly yet reserved nature and technical skills at mountaineers, the people of Nepal also devote much time to religion, whether it be Hinduism or Buddhism. Many of the festivals and celebrations are based on religious practices.

                A multi-ethnic, multi-religious, and multilingual country, Nepal is the birthplace of Buddha, who was born in the Kapilavastu district in a place known as Lumbini. During 500 B.C.E., Queen Mayadevi gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama, also called Buddha.

                Nepal’s mountain region makes up about 64% of the country’s land area, formed by the Mahabharat range and lower Churia range. The lowland Terai, a flat river area of the Ganges, occupies about 17% of the country.

                Summing up the attractions in Nepal can be difficult, as the country is as mysterious as it is mountainous. While Mount Everest certainly is a landmark that comes to mind, the country also has contrasts to its mountains. The terrain can also be flat and the climate oppressively warm.

            <h5><b>Kathmandu</b></h5>
            <p2>
                The capital of Nepal, Kathmandu, features many religious monuments and historic sites. Some of the attractions include Patan Durbar Square, and the Swayhambhunath, Bhaktapur, and Boudhanath stupas. You can also enjoy short hikes around the city where, on clear days, you can view the Himalayas. Regardless of where you stay in the capital, you will need to acclimatize yourself to the elevations and climate. This is especially important if you plan to hike around the area.

            <h5><b>Pokhara</b></h5>
            <p2>
                The scenic city of Pokhara is not quite as bustling as the capital of Kathmandu. Most tourists can be found along Phewa Lake in the city. The city of Pokhara is also a good starting point for a trip to the district of Sanangkot Visitors like taking the 6-mile round trip excursion to see the sun rise over the Himalayas. For anyone planning a trek through the Annapurna range. Pokhara is the beginning point.

                Some mountain trekkers prefer going through the Annapurna range versus trekking to Everest Base Camp, as climbing to the base camp requires ascending about 5,380 meters or 17,650 feet high – a major change in elevation if you are not used to it. You can also take optional treks in Nepal if you so desire. These treks offer great views along with natural hot springs. You can also visit hillside villages and lakes as you travel along the paths

            <p2>
